## What is cimplems?

Cimplems (Simple CMS) is a content management system designed for simplicity. It features:

* **Easy installation:** Utilizes an XML flat file database.
* **User-friendly interface:** WYSIWYG administration with all actions on a single page.

With cimplems, you can create standard pages, manage multiple galleries, and interact with visitors through the contact page. All pages can be toggled ON or OFF, and putting the home page offline activates "under construction" mode.

## How does it work?

Hover over each button to see its function and experiment to get familiar with the available features.

## What's the tech stack?

* **Back-end:** Laravel 8
* **Front-end:** jQuery and Bootstrap

The CMS is reactive by default but can be customized in the config file (`root_website_dir/config/site.php`).

## Languages and Themes

* **Languages:** Localization available for English and French (default configurable in the config file). Create your own language files in `root_website_dir/resources/lang/`.
* **Themes:** Three bootstrap themes are available: "bootstrap" (default), "default" (simple), and "blog". Create your own themes in `root_website_dir/resources/views/themes/` and `root_website_dir/public/themes/`.
